This project is all about recognizing image, it finds any image that you give as an input; if and only if it is stored in your Corpus or the image folder (faces) inside the project materials. 
Really, it gets exactly the one that you want to find by indicating the face of the image a rectangle sign and declares the name of the person that belongs with that image by reading the name of the person from the image title.
